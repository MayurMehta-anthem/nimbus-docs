== Rule Configuration

.Framework comes with support for Drools Rules (https://www.drools.org/) engine out of the box. The rules can be defined at multiple levels.
* Entity Level: Rules defined at the entity level gets triggered everytime the entity is updated. Typically business rules that manage the entity state would be defined at this level. The framework would pick any rule with the extension <domainalias>.drl and associate with the entity updates. The rule would have access to the entity domain that it is being executed. 
* Function Handler: Business rules that can span across multiple entities or needs to be controlled based on business flow rather than everytime entity is updated can be configured using Function handler. Please refer to the Function Hanlder documentation for more information on configuring these rules.

== Process Configuration

=== Business Process Configuration

=== Framework Function Handlers

. The fremwork provides the following function handlers out of the box
* _set: Sets parameter value.
* _bpm: Invokes a statless bpm process.
* _add: Adds parameter value to a collection.
* _setByRule: Set parameter value through a rule.
