    1. State the purpose of Nimbus (as a product and framework)
    2. State the vision, value and customer
    3. Identify similar solutions on the market

=== Content
   1. PURPOSE: To create a flexible and expandable product that can adapt quickly to customer requirement changes, while minimizing the need to rewrite large sections of code and the overall cost to change.
    2. VISION: To create the next generation CM platform for Anthem, its partners and its customers.  
    3. VALUE: The Nimbus platform flexibility enables it to be sold to the market as a product, versus a set of IT services.  
    4. CUSTOMERS: This helps Anthem lead in this competitive market for provider and other payer customers.
    5. Project will be using an Agile Lifecycle Management methodology to deliver usable software in the least amount of time and to maximize as much visibility/impact to the organization.

=== Values

    1. Focus - 
    Because we focus on only a few things at a time, we work well together and produce excellent work. We deliver valuable items sooner.
    2. Courage - 
    Because we work as a team, we feel supported and have more resources at our disposal. This gives us the courage to undertake greater challenges.
    3. Openness -
    As we work together, we express how we're doing, what's in our way, and our concerns so they can be addressed.
    4. Commitment -
    Because we have great control over our own destiny, we are more committed to success.
    5. Respect -
    As we work together, sharing successes and failures, we come to respect each other and to help each other become worthy of respect.

== Team Structure

=== Purpose
    Define how the Nimbus team is organized

=== Objectives
    Explain the different team layers
    Define framework, product and application
    Explain difference between framework and product

=== Content
    The Nimbus team is divided into several layers, although some may overlap as product development advances toward deployment.
        1.	Green – Framework Team ensures developers have the right tools to build the product
        2.	Orange – Product Team builds the product using the framework toolset
        3.	Blue – Implementation Team that ensures the product is implemented at a customer location and ensures preferences/settings are setup as well as appropriate integrations established

    The framework is the development toolset that is the core foundation on which products are built.  There are no product-specific functionalities in this layer – just the platform that each new product will be using once developed.

    The product is the application or the collective set of applications, once entirely built, that can be sold to external customers or implemented internally.  All products are built on the same development framework and platform.

    An application is the customer-facing tool that may be part of a larger product.
